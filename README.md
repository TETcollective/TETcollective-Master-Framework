## Abstract

This repository contains the comprehensive paper integrating the TET–CVTL device development with the full theoretical framework of a supersymmetric non-orientable de Sitter universe compactified on the Riemann sphere. The 3-6-9 invariant is rigorously derived, and practical implications for vacuum energy extraction are discussed.
